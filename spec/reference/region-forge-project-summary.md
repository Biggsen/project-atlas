# MC Region Maker - Project Summary

**Last Updated:** 2024  
**Status:** MVP Complete and Deployed

## Overview

**MC Region Maker** is a professional browser-based tool for defining and managing polygonal exploration regions over Minecraft biome map images. Draw regions directly on the map, manage complex configurations, and export WorldGuard-style region data.

## Current State: ✅ MVP Complete and Deployed

The MVP is complete and deployed to production (Vercel). The application is fully functional and ready for users.

## ✅ Completed Features

### Core Functionality
- ✅ **Map Loading**: Generate maps from seeds or load from URLs via integrated microservice
- ✅ **Region Drawing**: Draw polygonal regions by clicking points on the map
- ✅ **Coordinate System**: Automatic conversion between image pixels and Minecraft world coordinates
- ✅ **Grid Overlay**: Optional chunk grid (16×16 blocks) for precise alignment
- ✅ **Region Editing**: Comprehensive editing tools (move, resize, split, warp, simplify)
- ✅ **YAML Export**: Generate WorldGuard-compatible region configurations
- ✅ **Project Management**: Save and load complete projects with embedded map images
- ✅ **Region Search**: Quick search and filter regions by name
- ✅ **Village Management**: Import villages from CSV and assign to regions
- ✅ **Plugin Generators**: Generate configurations for Achievements, Events, and LevelledMobs
- ✅ **Custom Markers**: Place and manage custom markers on the map
- ✅ **Multi-Dimension Support**: Work with Overworld, Nether, and End maps
- ✅ **Region Statistics**: Calculate region areas and display center points

### UI/UX
- ✅ **Tab-Based Interface**: Organized Map → Regions → Export workflow
- ✅ **Dark Theme**: Modern, professional interface
- ✅ **Real-Time Updates**: Live preview of region YAML as you edit
- ✅ **Auto-Save**: Automatic persistence of regions and map state
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Works across different screen sizes
- ✅ **Image Validation**: Square dimension validation, size limits (250x250 to 2000x2000)
- ✅ **Loading States**: Async map generation with progress indicators
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Clear error messages and user feedback

### Security
- ✅ **SSRF Protection**: Image proxy validates URLs, blocks private IPs, DNS resolution
- ✅ **CORS Restrictions**: Environment-based origin whitelist
- ✅ **Content Security Policy**: CSP headers configured in Vercel
- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: Implemented on image proxy endpoints
- ✅ **Error Sanitization**: Production-safe error messages

### Bug Fixes
- ✅ **Region Creation Without Map**: "Create New Region" button disabled when no map is loaded, with clear messaging

## 🐛 Open Issues

### Medium Priority

#### 1. World Size Slider for Nether and End Dimensions
**Status:** Open  
**Priority:** Medium

**Description:** The Nether and End dimensions should have world size slider controls, similar to the Overworld dimension.

**Issue:**
- Currently, world size slider may only be available for Overworld dimension
- Nether and End dimensions should also allow users to adjust world size independently

**Affected Components:**
- World size controls (likely `WorldSizeHeading.tsx` or related components)
- Dimension selection/world type management (likely `useWorldType.ts` or related hooks)

**Expected Behavior:**
- World size slider should be available and functional for all dimensions (Overworld, Nether, End)
- Each dimension should maintain its own world size setting if applicable

## 🚧 Outstanding Work

### High Priority

#### File Upload Functionality
- [x] URL loading for map images ✅
- [x] Map generation from seed ✅
- [ ] Drag & drop file upload for local images (nice-to-have, not MVP requirement)
- [ ] File validation (PNG, JPG format)
- [ ] Display upload progress/loading state (for file uploads)
- [ ] Handle upload errors gracefully (for file uploads)

**Note:** URL loading and seed generation cover all essential use cases. File upload depends on user accounts feature (see `spec/user-accounts-spec.md`).

---

### Medium Priority

#### Enhanced Drawing Tools
- [ ] Chunk snapping for precise region boundaries
- [ ] Rectangle drawing tool
- [ ] Circle drawing tool
- [ ] Undo/redo functionality
- [ ] Delete individual points while drawing

#### Improved UI/UX
- [x] Basic zoom controls ✅ (mouse wheel zoom, space+drag pan)
- [x] Zoom to region ✅ (zoom to selected region bounds)
- [ ] Zoom to fit (automatically fit map to canvas on load)
- [ ] Mini-map for navigation
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts
- [x] Region search/filter in sidebar ✅
- [ ] Bulk region operations (duplicate, merge)
- [x] Bulk delete ✅ (delete all regions implemented)

---

### Nice to Have

#### Advanced Features
- [ ] Region templates/presets
- [ ] Region categories/tags
- [ ] Region descriptions/notes
- [ ] Region validation (check for overlapping regions)
- [x] Region statistics (area calculation exists) ✅
- [ ] Region perimeter calculation

#### Performance & Technical
- [x] Loading states for operations ✅ (map generation, import/export have loading states)
- [x] Error handling ✅ (basic error handling implemented)
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling across all operations
- [ ] Optimize canvas rendering for large maps
- [ ] Add unit tests
- [ ] Add integration tests

#### User Experience
- [ ] Onboarding system (step-by-step guides, tutorials, tooltips) - **Post-MVP**
- [ ] Keyboard navigation support
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility
- [ ] High contrast mode
- [ ] Colorblind-friendly UI
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness improvements

### Security - Partial Implementation

#### File Upload Validation
**Status:** Partially Implemented
- ✅ Image dimension validation exists
- ❌ Missing file size limits (10MB)
- ❌ Missing MIME type validation for JSON imports
- ❌ Missing JSON parsing limits/timeouts

#### Security Headers
**Status:** Partially Implemented
- ✅ `X-Content-Type-Options` set in proxy-image.js responses
- ❌ Missing site-wide headers: X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy

#### Frontend URL Validation
**Status:** Not Implemented
- ❌ Still uses simple string checks (`startsWith('http')`)
- Should use `URL` constructor with proper hostname validation

#### Logging Utility
**Status:** Not Implemented
- ❌ No structured logging system exists
- Console.log still used throughout codebase
- Should implement environment-based logging utility
